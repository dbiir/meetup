**Invited Talk: Word embeddings and their research directions** [Slides](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~meetup/meetup_2018_11_03.pptx)

**[Bofang Li](http://bofang.stat-nba.com)**, hosted by [Guodong Jin](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~guodong/)

In recent years, there is a growing interest in word embedding models, where words are embedded into low-dimensional (dense) real-valued vectors. The trained word embeddings can be directly used for solving tasks like word similarity and word analogy, part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition.
This talk introduces the basic ideas of training word embedding models. It also discusses few directions of word embeddings based on the talkerâ€™s recent research experiences, regarding both effectiveness and efficiency.
