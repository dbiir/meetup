# Weekly Meetup

## Introduction to Weekly Meetup
Weekly Meetup is organized by a group of graduate students at [DBIIR Lab](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn), RUC(Renmin University of China).

The meetup is for one simple goal -- share our researching interests and improve our researching abilities together.

The meetup mainly consists of three sessions:
1. **Presentation**. Each time, one of group members gives a presentation of a recently read paper, or on-going researches. The rest ask questions and argue about it.
2. **BrainStorm**. Given a general topic related to our daily researches, group members discuss and debate over it. At the end of this session, the topic of next week is released.
3. **Invited Talks**. Occasionally, researchers outside the group is invited to give a talk on recent researches.
